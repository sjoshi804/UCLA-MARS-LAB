Pseudocode for pure c++ version of klt + vj face tracking:
- assume input is the set of all frames in the video labelled 1 ... n

Navie Method:
for every frame i:
    if i (mod5) == 0: // 5 can be changed to the granularity that experimentally works best
        run vj and detect faces
        for every face:
            run KLTSelectGoodFeaturesToTrack on the bounding box around said face
    else:
        for every face:
            using the previous feature list (refer to tracking in an image sequence from klt manual)
            find the position of the features
